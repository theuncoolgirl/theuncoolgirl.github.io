### Hi there, I'm Erin

### üöÄ
I am a motivated problem-solver and full stack engineer with a project management background. I am passionate about learning to build and building to learn, collaborating with others, and getting the job done while having fun doing it.

### üéß
I am currently seeking a full-time, remote position as a front-end or full-stack enginner with a company that values continuous learning and invests in its employees' growth. I thrive in transparent and collaborative environments and seek to work with a team that fosters a positive culture and is excited about the product we're building.


I am constantly attempting to level-up my skills as an engineer. I am currently developing a fully-functional e-commerce React single-page app as vehicle to learn new technologies, such as Typescript, Firebase, and integrating with the Stripe payments API, while also practicing my existing skills in leveraging Redux, Redux-Saga, and GraphQL.

### üçú
And, if I am away from the keyboard, you can usually find me DJing with my partner, in my roller skates, or hunting down my next bowl of ramen.
